Memgraph is an ACID compliant high performance transactional distributed
in-memory graph database featuring runtime native query compiling, lock free
data structures, multi-version concurrency control and asynchronous IO.

## Feature Specifications

Each prominent Memgraph feature requires a feature specification. The purpose
of the feature specification is to have a base for discussing all aspects of
the feature. Elements of feature specifications should be:

* High-level context.
* Interface.
* User stories. Usage from the end-user perspective. In the case of a library,
  that should be cases on how to use the programming interface. In the case of
a shell script, that should be cases on how to use flags.
* Discussion about concurrency, memory management, error management.
* Any other essential functional or non-functional requirements.
* Test and benchmark strategy.
* Possible future changes/improvements/extensions.
* Security concerns.
* Additional and/or optional implementation details.

It's crucial to keep feature spec up-to-date with the implementation. Take a
look at the list of [feature specifications](docs/feature_spec/contents.md) to
learn more about powerful Memgraph features.
