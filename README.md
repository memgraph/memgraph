## :clipboard: Description

Memgraph is a streaming graph application platform that helps you wrangle your
streaming data, build sophisticated models that you can query in real-time, and
develop graph applications.

Memgraph directly connects to your streaming infrastructure. You can ingest data
from sources like Kafka, SQL, or plain CSV files. Memgraph provides a standard
interface to query your data with Cypher, a widely-used and declarative query
language that is easy to write, understand and optimize for performance. This is
achieved by using the property graph data model, which stores data in terms of
objects, their attributes, and the relationships that connect them. This is a
natural and effective way to model many real-world problems without relying on
complex SQL schemas.

Memgraph is implemented in C/C++ and leverages an in-memory first architecture
to ensure that you’re getting the best possible performance consistently and
without surprises. It’s also ACID-compliant and highly available.
