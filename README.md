## :clipboard: Description

Memgraph is an open source graph database built for real-time streaming and
compatible with Neo4j. Whether you're a developer or a data scientist with
interconnected data, Memgraph will get you the immediate actionable insights
fast.

Memgraph directly connects to your streaming infrastructure. You can ingest data
from sources like Kafka, SQL, or plain CSV files. Memgraph provides a standard
interface to query your data with Cypher, a widely-used and declarative query
language that is easy to write, understand and optimize for performance. This is
achieved by using the property graph data model, which stores data in terms of
objects, their attributes, and the relationships that connect them. This is a
natural and effective way to model many real-world problems without relying on
complex SQL schemas.

Memgraph is implemented in C/C++ and leverages an in-memory first architecture
to ensure that you’re getting the [best possible
performance](http://memgraph.com/benchgraph) consistently and without surprises.
It’s also ACID-compliant and highly available.
