/// This method tries to find the optimal path for recovering a single replica.
/// Based on the last commit transferred to replica it tries to update the
/// replica using durability files - WALs and Snapshots. WAL files are much
/// smaller as they contain only the Deltas (changes) made during the
/// transactions while Snapshots contain all the data. For that reason we prefer
/// WALs as much as possible. As the WAL file that is currently being updated
/// can change during the process we ignore it as much as possible. Also, it
/// uses the transaction lock so locking it can be really expensive. After we
/// fetch the list of finalized WALs, we try to find the longest chain of
/// sequential WALs, starting from the latest one, that will update the recovery
/// with the all missed updates. If the WAL chain cannot be created, replica is
/// behind by a lot, so we use the regular recovery process, we send the latest
/// snapshot and all the necessary WAL files, starting from the newest WAL that
/// contains a timestamp before the snapshot. If we registered the existence of
/// the current WAL, we add the sequence number we read from it to the recovery
/// process. After all the other steps are finished, if the current WAL contains
/// the same sequence number, it's the same WAL we read while fetching the
/// recovery steps, so we can safely send it to the replica.
/// We assume that the property of preserving at least 1 WAL before the snapshot
/// is satisfied as we extract the timestamp information from it.
