# Compile Filter Expressions

Memgraph evaluates filter expression by traversing the abstract syntax tree of
the given filter. Filtering is a general operation in query execution.

Some simple examples are:
```
MATCH (n:Person {name: "John"}) WHERE n.age > 20 AND n.age < 40 RETURN n;
MATCH (a {id: 723})-[*bfs..10 (e, n | e.x > 12 AND n.y < 3)]-() RETURN *;
```

More real-world example looks like this (Ethereum network analysis):
```
MATCH (a: Address {addr: ''})-[]->(t: Transaction)-[]->(b: Address)
RETURN DISTINCT b.addr
UNION
MATCH (a: Address {addr: ''})-[]->(t: Transaction)-[]->(b1: Address)-[]->(t2: Transaction)-[]->(b: Address)
WHERE t2.timestamp > t.timestamp
RETURN DISTINCT b.addr
UNION
MATCH (a: Address {addr: ''})-[]->(t: Transaction)-[]->(b1: Address)-[]->(t2: Transaction)-[]->(b2: Address)-[]->(t3: Transaction)-[]->(b: Address)
WHERE t2.timestamp > t.timestamp AND t3.timestamp > t2.timestamp
return distinct b.addr
UNION
MATCH (a: Address {addr: ''})-[]->(t: Transaction)-[]->(b1: Address)-[]->(t2: Transaction)-[]->(b2: Address)-[]->(t3: Transaction)-[]->(b3: Address)-[]->(t4: Transaction)-[]->(b: Address)
WHERE t2.timestamp > t.timestamp AND t3.timestamp > t2.timestamp AND t4.timestamp > t3.timestamp
RETURN DISTINCT b.addr
UNION
MATCH (a: Address {addr: ''})-[]->(t: Transaction)-[]->(b1: Address)-[]->(t2: Transaction)-[]->(b2: Address)-[]->(t3: Transaction)-[]->(b3: Address)-[]->(t4: Transaction)-[]->(b4: Address)-[]->(t5: Transaction)-[]->(b: Address)
WHERE t2.timestamp > t.timestamp AND t3.timestamp > t2.timestamp AND t4.timestamp > t3.timestamp AND t5.timestamp > t4.timestamp
RETURN DISTINCT b.addr;
```

Filtering may take a significant portion of query execution, which means it has
to be fast.

The first step towards improvement might be to expose an API under which a
developer can implement its filtering logic (it's OK to support only C++ in the
beginning). Later on, we can introduce an automatic compilation of filtering
expressions.
