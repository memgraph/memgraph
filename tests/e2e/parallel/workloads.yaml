# Workload configuration for parallel e2e tests
#
# These tests are designed to run in parallel using pytest-xdist.
# Each test manages its own Memgraph instance via fixtures.
#
# Note: Unlike other e2e tests, parallel tests do NOT use the 'cluster' key
# because each pytest worker manages its own instance dynamically.
