(defn node-start-stopper
  "Takes a targeting function which, given a list of nodes, returns a single
  node or collection of nodes to affect, and two functions `(start! test node)`
  invoked on nemesis start, and `(stop! test node nodes-config)` invoked on nemesis stop.
  Also takes a nodes-config map needed to restart nodes.
  Returns a nemesis which responds to :start and :stop by running the start!
  and stop! fns on each of the given nodes. During `start!` and `stop!`, binds
  the `jepsen.control` session to the given node, so you can just call `(c/exec
  ...)`.

  The targeter can take either (targeter test nodes) or, if that fails,
  (targeter nodes).

  Re-selects a fresh node (or nodes) for each start--if targeter returns nil,
  skips the start. The return values from the start and stop fns will become
  the :values of the returned :info operations from the nemesis, e.g.:

      {:value {:n1 [:killed \"java\"]}}"
