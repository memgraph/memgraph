# JavaScript Example

This example is publicly available [here](
https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/how-to-guides-overview/query-memgraph-programmatically#javascript-example).
It's NOT automatically executed within the CI system because setting up the
environment to executed and test JavaScript from HTML is too much effort for
too little gain. It's possible to open HTML and test the functionality
manually.

IMPORTANT: `setup.sh` + `docs_how_to_query.html` and relevant docs page have
to be in sync.
